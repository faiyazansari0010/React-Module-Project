React Module Project - Pocket Notes App created using React JS
LIVE AT - https://pocket-notes-app-reactjs.netlify.app/

Description:

• Developed a responsive single-page application for managing note groups and individual notes using ReactJS and Redux Toolkit for global state management.

• Implemented dynamic routing with React Router v7 to navigate between groups and individual notes seamlessly.

• Enabled users to create unique note groups, assign colors, and generate automatic display initials for group avatars.

• Built modals for creating new groups using react-modal, with interactive validation to prevent duplicate or invalid group names.

• Designed CRUD functionality for adding and retrieving notes within groups, persisting all data in browser localStorage to ensure state is retained across sessions.

• Captured and displayed metadata such as creation and update timestamps for individual notes.

• Developed a mobile-responsive UI using CSS media queries to adapt layouts for both desktop and mobile devices, supporting view toggling on small screens.

• Utilized NanoID for generating unique identifiers for groups and notes to maintain data integrity.
